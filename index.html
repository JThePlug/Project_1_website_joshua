<h1 style="color: red"> The playstation 4.</h1>
<div>
<p style="color : red":>The playstation 4 is a way better console than the xbox one in my opinion.there are many things that the playstation has that the xbox one does not .There are many things that i am going to point out about the ps4,Like why it is such a better console that the xbox one,what are the things that make the xbox one so bad compared to the ps4,and why  you should get one.That is if you dont have one already.</P>

<p style ="color:red" >The ps4 had over 30 million copies sold in 2015,it is doing way better than the xbox one which had 15 million copies sold.The two consles compare eaach other with everything ,from how the controller is made,to even how the cables look.This all comes from how customers were upset because the xbox one was so bulky and the ps4 was so thin,the xbox one came really bulky wires,and the ps4 came with thin wires.</p>
<h1 style="color : Red">which is better?.</h1>

<p style="color : red">So many xbox fans have switched to ps4 because most people think that the graphics are better on the ps4,also many people dont like the cost of the xbox compared to the ps4.The ps4 is a much better system for a much better price than  the  xbox one.Some companys even sign deals with playstation to give them dlc earlier for games because it is doing much better than the ps4.</p>
