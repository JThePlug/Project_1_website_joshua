<p style ="color:red" >The ps4 had over 55 million copies sold in 2015,it is doing way better than the xbox one which had 1.5 million copies sold.The two consles compare eaach other with everything ,from how the controller is made,to  even hhow the cables look.This all ccomess from how customers were upset because the xbox one was so bulky and the ps4 was so thin,the xbox one came really bulky wires,and the ps4 came with thin wires.

<p>So many xbox fans have switched to ps4 because most people think that the ggraphics are better on the ps4,also many people dont like the cost of the xbox compared to the ps4.The ps44 is a muchh better system for a much better price than  the  xbox one.Some companys even sign deals with playstation to give them ddlc earlier for games because it is doing much better than the pps4.
