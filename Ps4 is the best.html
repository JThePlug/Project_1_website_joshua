<p style="color : blue" >The ps4 is better because it dosent tend to lag as much as the xbox one does.The xbox one can easily crash if it cant handle things like a glitch on a game,or if to many  things  are happening on screen.The ps4 has a better controller than the xbox one.The xbox ones controller needs a battery pack to work,and the ps4s controller just needs to be  charged and it is good to go for the next 4 or 5 days before it needs to be charged again.The ps4 and the xbox one play mostly the same games and honestly i have beenn watching vidos and doing research and side by side the ps4 has better graphics.</p>
